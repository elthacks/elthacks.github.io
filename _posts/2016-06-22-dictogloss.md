Today I had another lesson with the same third grade class I taught yesterday. I did a dictogloss of a text I first saw in an article by Scott Thornbury[^Scott] in [English Teaching professional](https://www.etprofessional.com/etp/default.aspx) – Leave-taking. Here is the text for your reading pleasure.

> **Leave-taking**
>
> He took her hand. She took his money.
> He took a lover.
> She took exception. He took leave of his senses. She took advice.
> He took fright.
> She took him to the cleaner's. He took to drink.
> She took a holiday.
> He took his life.
> She took up ballroom dancing.

The idea is that this shows just how much meaning and language is linked with that one verb, *take*; just look – we've got phrases for 'becoming an alcoholic', 'getting married', 'taking all of someone's money' and so on. Maybe not all such high frequency subjects, but interesting nonetheless.

I think this was a bit more challenging for the students than yesterday's session as they had to work to piece the text together from what they heard during the quick dictation – dictogloss texts are supposed to be dictated quickly so that the students can't write down all the words; instead they recreate the text from the fragments they do write down. See more about dictogloss on the [Teaching English British Council site](https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/dictogloss).

They got most of the text down, probably since the pattern was easy to follow – it was always 'he took...' or 'she took...', so they could easily write as I read the text. So, to push them further, I asked them to match the verb phrases with *take* with their meanings (becoming an alcoholic, and so on). 45 minutes is hard to get used to as a lesson length. It just seems to fly by so quickly. The session ended with me encouraging them to look for patterns with verbs like *take*, *give*, *ask*... I hope they'll appreciate that in their future English studies.
