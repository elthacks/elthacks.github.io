Today I had another lesson with the same third grade class I taught yesterday. I did a dictogloss of a text I first saw in an article by Scott Thornbury[^1] in [English Teaching professional](https://www.etprofessional.com/etp/default.aspx) â€“ Leave-taking. Here is the text for your reading pleasure.
