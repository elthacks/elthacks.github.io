Second day at DSŠL and second day of teaching – although I wasn't expecting to give a lesson today. I'd originally expected to arrive at 10am to observe and help out during a session focusing on a project on Physics and English. Students had been studying physics and English kind of in tandem over the year culminating in this project; they watched the film Interstellar and then chose a theme from the picture to investigate and present.

This isn't my first experience of TBLT[^TBLT] – I've done the soft-form of this approach to teaching in coursebooks like Cutting Edge, to give an example – but it's probably the first time I've witnessed it fully in practice. And this wasn't just plain vanilla TBLT, but with lashings of CLIL[^CLIL] added to the mix as well. But more on that later.

First of all let me tell you a little bit about the lesson I taught. This was with 3rd grade students (so I think 16/17) and I taught the same video telling lesson I did yesterday. One thing about dropping in to teach somewhere you haven't been before, without knowing the students before, is that you can't really get a handle on the level. And when the lessons are just 45 minutes long, it's difficult to go fully with an unplugged approach and get up and running. To give a flavour of my previous teaching context (where I last taught over two years ago now!) I am used to sessions running from two to two and a half hours – and I'd have got to know the students over time. Also, while I was teaching anything ranging from complete beginners up to fairly advanced, my classes would tend towards basic 'get by' English. So if there is a time where I'm going to misjudge the level of challenge, this stint in Slovenia is it.

So, what am I going to do? Well, I'm still sticking with something open-ended, but with perhaps a tad more focus than a simple video telling. Dictogloss is a technique I've fallen back over and over again in the past. It's a way of doing dictation that focuses less on the accurate listening to and transcribing of a sentence or text, but more on the process of putting a text together from disparate elements. Students listen as you read a text and write down whatever they can (you don't slow down specially for the dictation). Groups of students then attempt to put the text back together from whatever they've written down (or try to create a text with meaning as close to the original as possible). Focusing on a bit of work grammar (delexicalised verbs and collocation) I hope this will provide enough challenge and give them enough useful language (and knowledge *about* language) to be going on with.

That's the first lesson tomorrow morning. In the second, I'd like to set them the challenge of presenting something about their studies and school. Let's see how we get on with that ;)
