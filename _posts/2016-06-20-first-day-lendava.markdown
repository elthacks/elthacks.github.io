### Teaching in Slovenia

So, this is a blog where I'm going to keep all my notes from classes and sessions that I teach or observe while here on this trip in Slovenia. I'm visiting [DSŠL (Dvojeznična Sredna Šola Lendava) in Lendava](http://www.dssl.si/sl/), which is situated in the north east of Slovenia, really near to the border with Hungary. In fact, this is a bilingual school, and lessons are taught in Slovene and Hungarian. Lendava is Lendva in Hungarian (I'm guessing from the road signs).

#### Monday 20 June 2016

I taught 2A, the second grade of high school here – which starts from the age of 15. So that means that this was a group of 16/17 year olds in the second year out of four in secondary school. DSŠL is a vocational/ technical school, but this group were the gimnazija, meaning that they follow a more academic path.

**The lesson**

I did a video telling activity from [a Vine by Lele Pons](https://vine.co/v/OBeADtP7gQT) – basically I told the story but with some gaps, gaps that the students would fill in using vocabulary written/displayed on the board. Not too many problems with the vocab – they were able to explain 'bump into' for example – and I think they liked the video (it's a funny sketch, riffing on the typical 'boy meets girl' formula).

I think that this being the last week of school, and most of the students having done their final exams for the year, my expectations are going to be set quite low. Not because the students are not able, but because they'll be more relaxed in that way and I'll be more comfortable that way.
