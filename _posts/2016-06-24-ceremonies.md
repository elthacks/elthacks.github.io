Today was my last day in Lendava and I got to experience something quite interesting – the end of year ceremony. Held at the [Zavod za kulturo in promocijo Lendava (Lendava's Cultural Centre)](http://www.zkp-lendava.si), this is the final event of the year where students receive prizes and there are performances by a choir and – this year before they head off to Leipzig for a competition – a team of engineering students with a robotic dance performance!

First of all, I tried to think whether this was something that we did as a general thing in the UK. At my secondary school we'd have a prize day, but I think it took place in either the autumn or spring term. As a normal end of year thing, I don't think we had a ceremony like this. Of course, this is just going from my own school career, so others might have had a different experience.

I went back to my hotel to pack for the journey back to Ljubljana tomorrow – I'm going to be travelling back with Sandra's daughter and a friend of hers, and it's going to be quite early! Meanwhile, the students and teachers went back to the school for a few more things to round off the end of the year.

Yesterday was 'sport day' which meant that all the students and teachers could go to the local swimming pool (at a nearby hotel) for the morning. I think this and the ceremony today are a great way to end the year and send off the students on their summer break :)

Unfortunately I didn't get any photos of the robot! If you can understand Slovenian, then you can find out more on the [DSŠL website](http://www.dssl.si/robobum-2016/).
